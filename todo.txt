Goal: A DBMS implementation optimized for databases less than half the size of your memory. Redundantly stores data in
columns and rows so the query planner can always maximize read speed.

query processor
executor

select * from ciadocs where title="gap"

START: select * from ciadocs where title="____"
THEN: select ____ from ciadocs where title="____"

maybe later: aggregation functions - like a count iterator.
arg takes thing it's counting, assumes it's sorted

fn(value)

MAIN
calls iterators
that read data

Goal: sorting/hashing on disk could happen by subbing those iterators in
